[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/s4hana-hana-audit-policies)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/s4hana-hana-audit-policies)

## Description
This project provides HANA audit policy templates for the SAP HANA database tenant used by SAP S/4HANA. The HANA audit policy templates for S/4HANA provide a set of policies.

1. **Mandatory HANA Audit Policies** (File: 1_hana_audit_policy_mandatory.sql)  
A first set of policies defined as mandatory ensure traceability of security relevant changes. These have the prefix '_SAP_'. They are identical to the audit policies provided by "SAP HANA Cockpit Audit Policy Wizard" (starting with SAP HANA Cockpit 2.0 SP13). These policies are set as defaults for HANA database tenant used by S/4HANA for new installations with SAP S/4HANA 2021 and SAP BW/4HANA 2021 and later. For conversions and system copies, HANA audit policies are only enabled as defaults in case no other HANA audit policies are existing.
1. **S/4HANA Schema Access Log HANA Audit Policies** (File: 2_s4hana_hana_audit_policy_recommended.sql)  
The second set of policies define "recommended" policies for S/4 systems. These have the prefix '_SAPS4_'. These policies vary with the usage of the SAP HANA DB and cannot be defined identical for all systems.
1. **S/4HANA Optional HANA Audit Policies** (File: 3_s4hana_hana_audit_policy_optional.sql)  
The third set called “optional” suggests policy definition for extended system changelog and monitoring. These have the prefix '_SAPS4_Opt_'.
1. **S/4HANA HANA Audit Policies additional consideration** (File: 4_s4hana_hana_audit_policiy_additional.sql)  
The fourth called “additional” gives examples for policy definition for specific scenarios. It is not recommended to apply the policies without careful consideration. There is no predefined naming. Adoption cannot be done out of the box. Adjustments depend on the usage of an individual HANA database.
1. **S/4HANA Expose View on Auditlog** (File: 5_s4hana_expose_view_on_auditlog.sql)
The fifth file conatins an example implementation of a table function. It is needed if a part of the HANA audit log should to be exposed to a user without granting select on all audit entries.

## Requirements
To use those policies you need [SAP S/4HANA](https://www.sap.com/products/central-finance.html).

## Download and Installation
Information how to list and adjust HANA audit policies can be found on [SAP HANA Platform](https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP_HANA_PLATFORM) on the SAP Help Portal.

## Known Issues
- If technical users (e.g. ABAP Database user <SAPABAP1>, e.g. SAPHANADB, e.g. SAPDBCTRL) are not handled as described in the SQL files, a high number of HANA audit log events might be generated.
- If the global minimal retention period limit (INI parameter minimal_retention_period) is higher than the minimum period in a HANA audit policy, creation of the policy will fail.
- Additional comments for every policy are provided. Take them into consideration before activating a policy
